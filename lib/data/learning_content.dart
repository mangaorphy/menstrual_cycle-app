Understanding your menstrual cycle is key to understanding your body and reproductive health. The menstrual cycle is a monthly series of changes your body goes through to prepare for the possibility of pregnancy.

The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long, but normal cycles can range from 21 to 35 days. Your cycle is counted from the first day of your period to the first day of your next period.

Tracking your cycle can help you:
• Predict when your next period will start
• Identify your fertile window if you're trying to conceive
• Notice any unusual changes in your cycle
• Plan ahead for important events
• Better understand your body's natural rhythms

Remember, every person's cycle is unique. What's normal for you might be different from what's normal for someone else.

1. Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5): Your period begins. The lining of your uterus (endometrium) sheds.

2. Follicular Phase (Days 1-13): Your body prepares to release an egg. Estrogen levels rise.

3. Ovulation (Around Day 14): A mature egg is released from the ovary. This is your most fertile time.

4. Luteal Phase (Days 15-28): If pregnancy doesn't occur, hormone levels drop and the cycle begins again.
